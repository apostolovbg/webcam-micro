## Overview
- Use `PLAN.md` for active multi-slice work, not for durable product
  requirements.
- Record durable project requirements in `SPEC.md` when your repo uses SPEC.

- Record completed slice history in `CHANGELOG.md`.

- Mark completed items as `[done]` and outstanding items as `[not done]`.

- Prefer one roadmap that people can execute over a long wish list of vague
  intentions.

## Workflow
- Work in dependency order unless a real blocker forces reordering.

- Keep each item concrete enough that another person can continue it.

- Update status in the same session when work lands.

- Split very large themes into numbered items with clear closure criteria.

## Writing Direction
- State what the work is, why it matters, what has to happen, and how you
  will know it is done.
- Prefer plain language over slogans.

- Use bullets for requirements and acceptance checks.

- Treat vague work items as unfinished planning, not as good enough
  planning.

## Active Work
1. [not done] Work item title.
   Goal:
   - state the outcome this item must achieve
   Why this matters:
   - explain the problem this item resolves
   Work to do:
   - list the concrete implementation or documentation tasks
   Done when:
   - list the acceptance checks that prove this item is complete

2. [not done] Work item title.
   Goal:
   - state the next outcome this item must achieve
   Why this matters:
   - explain why this item belongs in the plan at this stage
   Work to do:
   - list the concrete tasks for this item
   Done when:
   - list the conditions that make this item complete

3. [done] Completed item example.
   Goal:
   - state the outcome this completed item delivered
   Completed work:
   - list what actually landed in the completed slice
   Outcome:
   - state what the completed item makes true

## Validation Routine
- Verify checks and tests pass.

- Verify generated artifacts are synchronized after refresh.

- Verify documentation and changelog were updated where behavior changed.

- Verify `devcovenant check` passes after the slice closes.
