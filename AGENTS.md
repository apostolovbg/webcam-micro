# Message from DevCovenant's Human (Read First)

This document is the canonical law of the project for both humans and
AI (artificial intelligence).
If you do not follow it, commits will fail, development quality will drift, and
the project will be compromised.

Read this entire file end-to-end before doing any work: this managed message,
the editable section, the workflow block, and the active policies.

Follow the required gate workflow. If you read this document carefully, you
will get to know everything about it.

Build an active-policy mental model from policies marked `enabled: true` and
follow those policies proactively while writing, not after violations appear.

Use the editable section as a live repository-specific notepad.
Keep notes short, factual, and current so they do not grow beards.
When decisions change, update notes in the same session.
When operational behavior changes, update notes so future sessions do not run
on stale assumptions.
Treat stale notes as drift and clear them.

Never edit content inside managed `<!-- DEVCOV* -->` blocks in any file.
Read `README.md` for project context and `devcovenant/README.md` for the
DevCovenant lifecycle and command behavior used by the project.
<!-- DEVCOV:END -->

# EDITABLE SECTION

## Editable-Section Hygiene
- Keep this section focused on repository-specific direction and
  constraints.
- Do not restate standard workflow steps that are already defined elsewhere.
- Update notes in the same session when decisions change.
- Remove stale notes immediately; stale notes are drift.

- YYYY-MM-DD: Add project-specific notes here. This section is preserved
  across install and refresh runs.

- 2026-04-04: Release version is sourced from `webcam_micro/VERSION`; the
  alpha shell chrome and package READMEs carry the full legal-owner notice.
- 2026-04-06: User Controls keep shell-managed brightness, contrast, hue,
  saturation, sharpness, and gamma rows visible even when the camera
  backend lacks matching setters; backlight compensation and white
  balance remain camera-owned rows when exposed.
- 2026-04-06: macOS camera controls now prefer the Qt Multimedia
  backend for exposure, ISO, backlight, focus, and white balance when
  those setters are available; AVFoundation remains fallback and must
  fail closed on unsupported custom-exposure paths.
- 2026-04-06: Automatic Video HDR rows are gated by active-format
  support; unsupported USB cameras must skip the control instead of
  touching the AVFoundation getter.

## Workflow Contract
This block defines the mandatory execution contract for repository work.
Use it as the operational checklist for every session.

## Overview
DevCovenant converts policy prose into executable checks. This file is the
canonical policy source and operational guide for the repository.

## THE DEV COVENANT
- We are human and AI developers working on this project together.
- We obey every AGENTS.md and DevCovenant instruction.
- We treat a human prompt ending with `?` as a question only and do not
  execute commands, edit files, or start a work slice.
- We maintain clean repository hygiene and avoid unmanaged drift.
- We never edit content inside managed `<!-- DEVCOV* -->` blocks.

## Workflow
Use the mandatory execution order below for all repository changes,
including documentation-only edits.
Treat DevCovenant run artifacts as the primary debug surface for command
results. Prefer summary/tail/log inspection first. Normal-mode live
streaming is acceptable when concise, but verbose streaming can consume
significant tokens. Keep operator progress updates concise: report what
changed, what passed/failed, and the next step; avoid routine narration
during command waits.

## Execution Order (Mandatory)
1. On the first session in a new conversation, read the entire `AGENTS.md`
   before running work commands, including policy metadata and policy text.
2. On every session, reread this workflow block
   (`<!-- DEVCOV-WORKFLOW:* -->`) before any repository edits.
3. If `AGENTS.md` non-workflow content changed since the previous gate
   session, reread the entire `AGENTS.md` before work commands.
4. Inspect the `## Project Governance` block and treat
   `Compatibility Policy` as active development guidance before deciding
   whether to preserve or remove old contract shapes.
5. Build an active-policy mental model from policies marked `enabled: true`
   and follow those policies proactively while writing.
6. If the human prompt ends with `?`, treat it as a question only. Answer
   without executing commands, editing files, or starting a work slice.
7. If a managed environment is configured, activate/use it first. Run
   DevCovenant commands and tests in that environment. Installing
   DevCovenant in that environment is recommended.
8. Run `devcovenant gate --start` before any repository edits. For
   long-running commands, use non-PTY (pseudoterminal) execution for
   non-interactive DevCovenant commands, prefer low-frequency polling,
   and avoid verbose or large-output streaming by default.
   Polling cadence for long waits: 5s, 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s, 90s, 120s,
   150s, 180s, 240s, then every 60s.
   Do not narrate polling steps or cadence in routine progress updates
   unless the human explicitly asks.
9. Before applying edits, clear start-gate complaints. Blocking violations
   must be cleared; preferred behavior is to clear all complaints. When
   DevCovenant run artifacts are available, inspect summaries/tails/logs
   before rerunning commands.
10. Apply edits while following policy text and metadata proactively.
11. If any DevCovenant complaint appears (error, warning, or info), stop
   the requested task and clear blocking violations first. Use the latest
   `Run logs:` path and summary artifacts as the primary debug
   entrypoint.
12. Preferred behavior: clear all DevCovenant complaints before continuing,
   unless the human explicitly requests otherwise.
13. Run `devcovenant gate --mid` before `devcovenant run` to surface
   hook-induced mutations and blocking DevCovenant complaints early.
   `gate --mid`
   requires an open session, does not record lifecycle state, and may
   need an explicit rerun until hooks converge.
14. Run `devcovenant run`. For long runs, report status/run updates
   and final result, and prefer run-artifact summaries/tails before
   escalating to verbose streaming. Long silent waits in normal mode
   should surface `Please wait. In progress...`.
15. Run `devcovenant gate --end`. Use the same artifact-first output
   discipline as workflow runs. Gate commands do not run required
   workflow runs internally.
16. If end-gate hooks or checks produce additional changes or violations,
   use `devcovenant gate --status` for lifecycle inspection and inspect
   the latest run artifacts before rerunning required commands until the
   repository is clean. When gates require workflow runs, run
   `devcovenant run` explicitly and rerun the gate command.
17. Stage all changes after each completed work slice.

Audits are not a separate workflow mode. The same gate discipline applies.
Use `check` as the default read-only audit command. Gate commands own
refresh/autofix orchestration; lifecycle state writes are limited to
`gate --start` / `gate --end`; `gate --mid` is non-lifecycle.
Gate commands never run workflow runs internally.
When DevCovenant run artifacts are available, inspect `summary.txt`,
then `tail.txt` (if present), then full logs before using ad-hoc
redirects or verbose streaming. Normal-mode live streaming can be
acceptable when it stays concise, but verbose streaming can consume many
tokens. Prefer normal-mode streaming plus artifact-first inspection for
routine work. Reserve verbose streaming for explicit human request, no
DevCovenant run artifacts, or interactive I/O needs. Keep operator
updates concise (what changed, what passed/failed, next step) instead of
narrating routine waits, polling steps, or obvious command progress.

## Managed Environment
If a managed environment is configured, run DevCovenant from that
environment and run all workflow runs there as well.
Start required services before `devcovenant run` so runtime checks
execute against the active stack.

## Command Form
Primary command examples use on-PATH `devcovenant ...`.
If the CLI (command-line interface) is unavailable from source checkout, use
`python3 -m devcovenant ...`.
On Windows, `py -m devcovenant ...` is a common equivalent launcher form.

## Policy Block Contract
The policy block below is generated by DevCovenant from policy descriptors
and runtime metadata resolution. Treat it as managed and do not edit it
directly.
<!-- DEVCOV-WORKFLOW:END -->

<!-- DEVCOV:BEGIN -->
## Project Governance
This block reflects the repository's active project-governance state.
- Project Version: 0.2.0
- Project Stage: alpha
- Maintenance Stance: active
- Compatibility Policy: forward-only
- Versioning Mode: versioned
- Compatibility Guidance:
  Do not leave legacy fallbacks behind. Remove deprecated readers,
  aliases, and bridge paths instead of preserving them.

Every change must be logged in a new changelog entry dated today, under the
current version, with a three-line summary labeled Change/Why/Impact. Each
summary line must include an action verb listed in the summary_verbs
metadata and a Files block that lists only the touched paths for this
change. The policy compares the top changelog entry against the gate-start
top-entry fingerprint to require a fresh entry for each work session, while
resolving changed paths from the active gate session. If the top version
changes during the session, the new version section must be prepended above
the preserved previous top version section and that preserved pre-session
top entry must remain first in the previous section instead of relabeling
old entries. This rule depends on section placement, not on bump wording
inside the entry text.
Collection prefixes (when enabled) must be logged in their own changelog;
prefixed files may not appear in the root changelog. This keeps release
notes daily, file-complete, and traceable.

```

Manage dependency-maintenance artifacts as one coherent policy surface.
When dependency inputs change, lockfiles and repository
compliance artifacts must stay synchronized together.
Artifact ownership is declared through structured `surfaces` metadata.
Each surface defines one lock/report/license bundle with its own lock file,
direct dependency inputs, dependency selectors, license report path,
license directory, and optional hash-lock target matrix.
Surface selectors support role-based taxonomy for mixed ecosystems:
`intent`, `resolved`, and `package_manifest`.
Each surface may declare nested selector keys:
`dependency_files`, `dependency_globs`, `dependency_dirs`,
`dependency_role_files`, `dependency_role_globs`,
`dependency_role_dirs`.
Surface selectors decide when checks and license/report refresh must react.
Direct dependency inputs decide when a lock refresh must recompile.
Policy checks remain read-only. Autofixers may invoke declared policy
runtime actions, and explicit policy-born CLI commands may invoke those same
runtime actions manually. Remediation messaging may differ when autofix is
enabled versus disabled. When one Python surface enables
`generate_hashes`, DevCovenant resolves the full configured target closure
from `hash_targets` and writes an all-target hash lock or fails explicitly.
When a direct dependency does not bundle upstream license files in installed
metadata, repositories may declare `license_source_overrides` keyed by
normalized package name. Builtin overrides currently support `archive_url`
sources with templated `url` and `member_globs` fields.
Hash mode does not patch a host-local compile result or depend on
GitHub-specific dependency logic. Artifact refresh remains
deterministic/idempotent.

When user-facing files change (as defined by the user-facing selectors and
keywords), the documentation set listed here must be updated. User-facing
includes API surfaces, integration touchpoints, and any behavior that affects
the user's experience or workflow. Updated docs should mention the relevant
components by name so readers can find changes quickly. The policy also
enforces documentation quality standards such as clear core headings,
minimum depth, and readable structure. When `doc_routes` is configured,
each user-facing change must match at least one route and touch all mapped
docs.

Keep lines within the configured maximum so documentation and code remain
readable. Reflow long sentences or wrap lists rather than ignoring the limit.
Optional metadata escape hatches can allow long lines for URL-heavy content
or explicit marker patterns when repositories need targeted flexibility.

## Policy: Managed Environment

```policy-def
id: managed-environment
severity: error
auto_fix: 'false'
enforcement: active
enabled: 'false'
custom: 'false'
expected_paths:
- /usr/local/opt/python@3.14
expected_interpreters:
- /usr/local/opt/python@3.14/bin/python3.14
command_search_paths: []
cleanup_protected_paths: []
required_commands: []
manual_commands: []
managed_commands: []
```

DevCovenant must run from one execution environment described by this
policy's metadata. `expected_paths` and `expected_interpreters` point to
that target environment, while optional `command_search_paths` add extra
PATH entries for resolving required commands and optional
`cleanup_protected_paths` define extra roots that cleanup must never delete.
`required_commands` declare the commands that must resolve once the target
interpreter is selected, using the managed PATH plus any declared command
search paths. `manual_commands` document how a human can create or repair
the environment, and stage-scoped `managed_commands` define how
DevCovenant may prepare it automatically. Command templates may reference
`{current_python}` and `{current_bin}` for the currently running
interpreter, and `{managed_python}`, `{managed_bin}`, `{managed_root}`,
`{repo_root}` for the selected target environment. User-facing guidance
renders those path tokens with display-safe paths so local absolute roots do
not leak into routine messages.
The target environment may live inside the repository or outside it, as long
as the metadata declares the interpreter path or environment root that
DevCovenant should use. The policy itself is environment-neutral: a
repository may seed a local `.venv`, a bench-managed environment, a
container-managed environment, a system interpreter, or another tool-owned
layout in its active profile stack. DevCovenant should not assume the
builtin defaults profile picks one of those layouts for it.
Active managed-environment policy reuses the current interpreter when it
already satisfies the contract, re-executes CLI commands in the selected
interpreter when needed, and only runs bootstrap commands when the target
environment is still missing or invalid. Stage-scoped `managed_commands`
accept `start`, `run`, `end`, `command`, and `all` prefixes; non-start
commands may still reuse `start` bootstrap commands once when the target
environment is not ready. When no automatic bootstrap commands are
declared, non-gate `command` stage operations may keep using the current
interpreter until the target environment exists, while `start`, `run`, and
`end` remain strict about the target environment. If the resolved
interpreter is missing or not executable, DevCovenant fails explicitly
instead of falling through to wrapper adapters or alternate policy sources.
When enabled with empty metadata, the policy emits a warning so teams
fill the required context.

```

In-scope non-test modules must have corresponding tests under configured
test roots. The rule is metadata-driven and supports mirror enforcement for
selected source roots. The policy enforces structural source-to-test
alignment and rejects stale mirrored tests. Placeholder tests are not
allowed. Python test files must use unittest.TestCase-style definitions;
workflow execution runs the declared unittest command directly.

Enforce explicit error surfaces and block raw exception anti-patterns.
This policy flags bare `except`, broad `except Exception` handlers,
generic `raise Exception(...)`, and silent `except Exception: pass`
handlers in selected source files. Broad-handler waivers are explicit
through marker comments or marker regions.

In-scope modules with related tests must include assertion signals in those
related test files. This policy enforces assertion-quality coverage for
structural source-to-test relationships, while modules-need-tests enforces
source-to-test structural alignment itself.
Tautological assertions (for example always-true checks) do not count as
assertion signal unless explicitly annotated as fixture-only using comment
marker `DEVCOV_FIXTURE_OK: <reason>` immediately above the assertion.

## Policy: Version Governance

```policy-def
id: version-governance
severity: error
auto_fix: 'false'
enforcement: active
enabled: 'true'
custom: 'false'
scheme: pep440
enforce_bumping: 'true'
canonical_versions_required: 'false'
version_file: webcam_micro/VERSION
changelog_file: CHANGELOG.md
changelog_header_prefix: '## Version'
ignored_prefixes: []
semver_scope_tags_required: 'false'

calver_pattern: []
custom_regex_pattern: []
custom_adapter_path: []
selector_roles: ignored
ignored_globs: []
ignored_files: []

```

When enabled, this policy governs repository version format and optional
version progression under the configured `scheme`. Repositories may enable
`enforce_bumping` to require forward version movement, while format-only
custom schemes may leave bump enforcement disabled. Scheme adapters may be
builtin or repo-defined and may add extra release rules to the latest
changelog entry.
Activation is controlled by `config.yaml -> policy_state`. Repositories
should choose `version-governance.scheme` explicitly in profile or config
metadata, then tune bump enforcement to match the selected scheme.

## Policy: Version Sync

```policy-def
id: version-sync
severity: error
auto_fix: 'true'
enforcement: active
enabled: 'true'
custom: 'false'
version_file: webcam_micro/VERSION
target_roles:
- docs
- changelog
- package_manifest
role_extractors:
- docs=>project_version_line
- changelog=>changelog_header_version
- package_manifest=>manifest_project_version
role_legality_schemes:
- package_manifest=>pep440
target_role_files:
- docs=>README.md
- docs=>AGENTS.md
- docs=>CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs=>SPEC.md
- docs=>PLAN.md
- changelog=>CHANGELOG.md
- package_manifest=>pyproject.toml
target_role_globs: []
target_role_dirs: []
changelog_file: CHANGELOG.md

selector_roles:
- target
target_globs: []
target_files: []
target_dirs: []
```

All version-bearing targets must match the canonical version file (default
`VERSION` or a configured override).
Target selection is role-based via `target_roles` and role selectors
(`target_role_files`, `target_role_globs`, `target_role_dirs`) with
`role=>selector` entries. Version extraction is role-driven via
`role_extractors` and explicit extractor names
(`project_version_line`, `changelog_header_version`,
`manifest_project_version`). Manifest extraction remains format-aware
(TOML/JSON/YAML) while selector routing stays role-based. Version-sync
validates and compares every extracted value through the active
`version-governance` scheme so canonical docs, changelog, manifests,
and any opted-in legal text stay synchronized even when repositories
use non-SemVer version formats. Optional `role_legality_schemes`
entries add stricter ecosystem legality for selected roles without
collapsing repo-level version governance back into one packaging-only
scheme. Autofix repairs mismatched declared targets by rewriting the
target's version token to the current canonical version.
